# rally-vite-template

A Vite template for getting started developing custom Broadcom Rally applications using a modern approach


## Setup 

To scaffold in current folder

`npx degit am283721/rally-vite-template`

To scaffold in a new sub folder

`npx degit am283721/rally-vite-template new-rally-app`

Then

`npm i`

`npm run dev -- --open`

You will need to have an active Rally session, or login when prompted.

Best practice is to append an `_apiKey` to the URL so it looks like this:

`http://localhost:3000/?apiKey=_yourAPIkey1234`
